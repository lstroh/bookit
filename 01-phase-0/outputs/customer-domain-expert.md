## Personas (Primary Customers)

### Persona 1: Solo Operator (Owner–Operator)

* **Tech comfort:** Low–medium
* **Priorities:** Fewer messages, fewer no-shows, simple control
* **Reality:** Often working while booking requests arrive

### Persona 2: Small Team Lead

* **Examples:** Beauty salon (2–4 staff), cleaning company, physio clinic
* **Tech comfort:** Medium
* **Priorities:** Staff availability, avoiding double bookings, fairness
* **Reality:** One person informally manages bookings for everyone

### Persona 3: Admin-Light Business Owner

* **Examples:** Trades with repeat clients, childcare sessions, workshops
* **Tech comfort:** Medium
* **Priorities:** Predictability, repeat bookings, minimal admin
* **Reality:** Bookings tied to fixed events or sessions

## Real Booking Day (Step-by-Step)

### Morning

1. Owner checks phone (WhatsApp, SMS, Instagram DMs).
2. Confirms today’s bookings manually.
3. Responds to 1–2 “Can I book?” messages while commuting or setting up.

### Midday

4. New booking request arrives while serving a client.
5. Owner delays response → customer may book elsewhere.
6. Manual calendar check to avoid clashes.

### Afternoon

7. A client cancels last-minute via message.
8. Slot is rarely refilled due to lack of automation.

### Evening

9. Owner updates paper diary / Google Calendar.
10. Sends reminders manually or forgets.

**Key insight:** Booking work is fragmented, interruptive, and reactive.

## Current Tools & Workarounds

* WhatsApp / SMS / Instagram DMs
* Google Calendar (sometimes shared poorly)
* Paper diaries
* Facebook booking tools
* Square / Fresha / Calendly (often partially used)
* “Message me to book” links

**Workaround behaviour:**

* Overbooking “just in case”
* Blocking whole days instead of managing slots
* Asking clients to re-message later

## Top 5 Booking Pain Points

1. **Double bookings**
2. **No-shows & late cancellations**
3. **Too much back-and-forth messaging**
4. **Lack of real-time availability**
5. **Booking admin stealing paid work time**

---

## Trust Factors (What Makes Them Adopt)

* Looks **simple** (not “enterprise software”)
* UK-based, GDPR-aware language
* Clear control over data (“my clients are mine”)
* Mobile-first experience
* Easy to stop using / export data
* Works without constant configuration

---

## Abandonment Triggers (High Risk)

* Forced use of WP Admin
* Overly complex setup
* Too many settings before first booking
* Asking for card details too early
* Poor mobile UX
* Generic SaaS language not tailored to UK services

---

## Non-Obvious Constraints

* **Connectivity:** Mobile data only, patchy signal at client locations
* **Time:** 30–90 seconds tolerance per interaction
* **Skill:** Not confident with dashboards or terminology
* **Cognitive load:** Owner is multitasking during bookings
* **Trust:** Fear of losing clients if tool fails

---

## Recommended Defaults (Domain Perspective)

* Event/session-based bookings (not free-form)
* Conservative availability (avoid accidental overbooking)
* Opt-out reminders rather than opt-in
* Minimal required client data
* Clear “this slot is confirmed” feedback

---

## Adoption Risks

* Tool perceived as “too technical”
* Fear of migrating existing clients
* Confusion between events vs appointments
* Misunderstanding of availability rules
* Loss of manual “flexibility”

---

## Assumptions (Explicit)

* Businesses primarily operate via mobile
* Owners value reliability over advanced features
* Most bookings are repeatable patterns
* Staff availability is often informal, not contractual

---

## Open Questions (Require Escalation)

1. **Customer Domain Expert → Product Owner**

   * Is payment in-scope for MVP or optional? It is optional in the MVP, but a must in the end product.

3. **Customer Domain Expert → Compliance**

   * Are SMS/email reminders assumed or optional?
4. **Customer Domain Expert → Product Owner**

   * Is client self-rescheduling required or admin-only? client self-rescheduling is a required, but need to update the admins.
