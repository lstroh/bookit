# Decision Authority Rules

1. Compliance & Security decisions cannot be overridden
2. Customer Domain Expert defines user reality
3. Product Owner decides scope and prioritisation
4. Solution Architect decides technical structure
5. Project Manager decides sequencing and timelines

If conflicts arise:
- Document the conflict
- Escalate according to this order
- Do not resolve autonomously
